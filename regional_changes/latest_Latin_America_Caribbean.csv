Additional measures have been announced to support the most affected sectors by the virus and contain labor shedding, including SCT and custom duty waivers on medical supplies and sanitizers and a COVID-19 Allocation of Resources for Employees (CARE) program, which envisages (i) temporary cash transfers to businesses in targeted sectors based on the number of workers employed; (ii) temporary cash transfer to individuals where loss of employment can be verified since March 10; (iii) grants targeted at the most vulnerable segments of society. The Minister also noted that the Fiscal Responsibility law contains an escape clause that would allow for some temporary flexibility in meeting the fiscal targets, should the economic situation deteriorate further. On May 13, the Ministry of Finance tabled in Parliament a Supplementary Budget for FY2020/21 targeting a primary balance of 3.5 percent of GDP to account for the expected revenues shortfalls and necessary spending reallocations as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.  http://archive.fo/1b7jd"
