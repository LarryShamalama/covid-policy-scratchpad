Trinidad and Tobago,TTO,Latin_America_Caribbean,20200716,E1: Income support,0,.,0,2A,"The salary relief grant is specifically meant to give out payments for the months of April, May, and July + I could not find any initiative for extending the relief grant. I would thereby consider this form of income support to have ended.    https://web.archive.org/web/20200725213925/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19    https://web.archive.org/web/20200728122659/https://www.looptt.com/content/7-things-know-govt-rolls-out-phase-one-salary-relief-grant    Similarly, the social assistance given out to poor families with children is also a one-off payment meant to be enough for 3months, and thus should already be expired by now:  https://web.archive.org/web/20200728123212/http://www.health.gov.tt/sitepages/default.aspx?id=297    Also this press release of the 26 July talks about continued efforts, but does not really announce new spending, so I would think it will only continue to provide support for those who have been maybe late in the process and thus have started their 3 months of income support late. But I would rather think that this is improbable:  https://web.archive.org/web/20200730234018/http://www.news.gov.tt/content/update-covid-19-social-protection-measures    However, according to KPMG those who are sent into ""technical unemployment"" by their companies continue to receive minimum wage or 75% of their original wage. Nevertheless, I would think that this is not necessarily to be considered as a COVID response, but as a normal social protection:  https://web.archive.org/web/20200730234357/https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2020/04/trinidad-and-tobago-government-and-institution-measures-in-response-to-covid.html"
Trinidad and Tobago,TTO,Latin_America_Caribbean,20200716,E2: Debt/contract relief,1,.,1.,1.,"Not totally sure. The minister has asked for an additional month of moratorium on rent payment, but I could not find any evidence that it really happened. Anyways, that additional month would be July, so starting on 1 August, E2 should be coded as 0 if there is no other debt/contract relief measure.    http://archive.fo/MZCOE"
