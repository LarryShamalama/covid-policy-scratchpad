Bangladesh,BGD,South_Asia,20200627,E2: Debt/contract relief,2,.,2.,2.,"http://archive.fo/wip/ZAPI7  Key Policy Responses as of June 25, 2020    FISCAL  The government has introduced a series of fiscal measures to contain and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. At end-March, the Ministry of Finance issued a revised budget for FY20 including additional resources to fund the Ministry of Healthâs COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan and expanding existing transfer programs that benefit the poor. Increased allocation has been made to the Open Market Sale (OMS) program to facilitate the purchase of rice at one-third of the market price, and the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief is distributing food supplies at the district level. On March 31, the Ministry of Finance announced a Tk. 50 billion (about USD 588 million) stimulus package for exporting industries to be channeled through a refinance scheme operated by Bangladesh Bank. Loan proceeds will be used to pay worker salaries, primarily through mobile financial services, and the scheme is expected to benefit close to 4 million workers for a three-month period. Exporting firms that have laid off workers will not qualify for the loans. The Ministry of Finance will also subsidize interest payments on up to Tk. 500 billion in working capital loans by scheduled banks to businesses. On April 15th, the Prime Minister announced the allocation of Tk. 21.3 billion under a housing scheme for the homeless, Tk. 7.6 billion for poor people having lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic, Tk. 7.5 billion to provide health insurance for government employees most at risk, and a Tk. 1 billion bonus payment for government doctors and health workers treating COVID-19 patients. Recently, the Prime Minister announced that the government would cover Tk. 20 billion in interest payments on behalf of 13.8 million loan recipients negatively impacted by the national shutdown. The National Board of Revenue has suspended duties and taxes on imports of medical supplies, including protective equipment and test kits. The FY21 Budget presented on 11 June includes higher allocations for health and social safety net programmes. The government has approached international financial institutions seeking budget support, and similar requests have been addressed to bilateral development partners.    MONETARY AND MACRO-FINANCIAL  The focus of Bangladesh Bank (BB) is to ensure that there is adequate liquidity in the financial system to support the operations of financial institutions, and it has announced that it will buy treasury bonds and bills from banks. The repo rate was lowered from 6 percent to 5.75 percent effective March 24th and was further reduced to 5.25 percent effective April 12. The CRR was initially reduced from 5 percent to 4.5 percent (daily-basis) and from 5.5 percent to 5 percent (bi-weekly basis), with a further reduction to 3.5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, from April 15. Recently, CRR was cut to 1.5% (daily basis) and 2.0% (bi-weekly basis) for offshore banking operation, effective July 1, and 1.0% (daily basis) and 1.5% (by-weekly basis) for NBFIs, effective June 1. BB has also raised the advance-deposit ratio (ADR) and investment-deposit ratio (IDR) by 2 percent to facilitate credit to the private sector and improve liquidity in the banking system. The Export Development Fund was raised to $5 billion, with the interest rate now fixed at 2 percent and the refinancing limit increased. BB has created several refinancing schemes amounting to a total of Tk 380 billion and a 360-day tenor special repo facility to support exporters, farmers and to facilitate the implementation of the government stimulus packages. To further support farmers, BB also announced an agriculture subsidy program that will take effect for 15 months until mid-2021. In addition, BB has taken measures to delay non-performing loan classification, waive credit card fees and interests, suspend loan interest payments, impose restrictions on bank dividend payments, extend tenures of trade instruments, and ensure access to financial services.    EXCHANGE RATE AND BALANCE OF PAYMENTS  Foreign exchange rules were eased by Bangladesh Bank to provide foreign currency to the Bangladeshi nationals who are visiting abroad and facing problem in returning home due to travel disruptions, and to allow foreign owned/controlled companies operating in Bangladesh to access short term working capital loans from their parent companies/shareholders abroad to meet actual needs for payments of 3-month wages and salary. It also resumed sales of the US dollar to offset extra pressure on the market caused by lower remittance inflows following the COVID-19 outbreak."
