In Wales and Scotland, sectors including indoor gyms and swimming pools remain closed.  The following businesses and venues in England are due to reopen from 25 July, as outlined in the table below with links to guidance to ensure their safe opening: Indoor fitness and dance studios, Indoor gyms, Indoor sports courts and facilities, Indoor swimming pools and indoor water parks. So as of 22 July, some sectors are still closed in England. In the city of Leicester, which is under a stricter lockdown due to a rise in cases, most businesses are closed, though cafes and restaurants can operate takeaway services. I have coded this as a 2 (some sectors closed), as these are not essential workplaces, which is the same coding as the rest of GBR, so the coding remains as a 2G despite this internal variation within 2.
