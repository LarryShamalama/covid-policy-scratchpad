Australia,AUS,East_Asia_Pacific,20200712,H2: Testing policy,3,.,3.,3.,"12th July   Clusters in Victoria and Sydney   Australian contacts tell us that it is common knowledge that no one is ever turned away from a test. It is not recommended by the government still that asymptomatic people get tested because in their results, they provide little yield. However as clusters have. broken out in Victoria and now Sydney, many people have been concerned that there is a conflicting message.  On one hand they're saying anyone who has gone into these areas must be tested regardless of symptoms. On the other hand, they have said asymptomatic people don't require a test.  ***H2 definition isâ  ""Open public testing (e.g âdrive throughâ testing available to asymptomatic people)."" This is true, as asymptomatic testing  is ""available"" just not ""recommended"".***  There is a transcript from the Deputy Chief Medical Officer from 12th July that confirms asymptomatic testing:  It has always been ""available"", meeting your criteria, but going one step further, in outbreak areas the medical officer is recommending asymptomatic testing. He admits in this statement that asymptomatic testing has been conducted (therefore available), inferring this is the practice generally aside from cluster areas.  ""The reality, from the Victorian experience that we've seen, is that there have been many, many thousands of tests conducted on asymptomatic individuals for very little yield- but when I say yield very few positives out of the asymptomatic testing that's being conducted down there.  ""The asymptomatic test has a role in places where there's local small clusters, so the Casula case is a very good example. So we don't want to miss any cases in that sort of scenario, therefore we're going to recommend asymptomatic testing.""  Australian Department of Health Source: http://archive.vn/zFZNu  "
