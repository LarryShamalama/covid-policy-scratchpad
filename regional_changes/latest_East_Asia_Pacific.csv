Australia,AUS,East_Asia_Pacific,20200612,,C3: Cancel public events,1,0,1T,2G,"Today the government announced that for outdoor venues up to 40,000 spectator capacity, ticketed and seated events will be able to be held in front of a crowd of no more than 25 per cent of capacity. Also social distancing of 1 person per 4sqm and/or staying 1.5 metres away from other people must be adhered to whenever and wherever possible, and also maintain good hygiene of handwashing.     However, it is up to individual States and territories to make decisions on when to move to this situation. It is likely that some states will not want to change things too quickly, for example Victoria where there are more cases is easing restrictions more slowly.    This doesn't include non-ticketed standing events such as music festivals.    https://web.archive.org/web/20200622145532/https://www.pm.gov.au/media/update-coronavirus-measures-12june20"

The easing of restrictions is ultimately decided State-by-State, and hence the reason I have used the targeted code.    https://web.archive.org/web/20200622145532/https://www.pm.gov.au/media/update-coronavirus-measures-12june20"
