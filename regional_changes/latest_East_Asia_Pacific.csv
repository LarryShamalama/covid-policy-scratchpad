Philippines,PHL,East_Asia_Pacific,20200703,E1: Income support,1,0,1F,1F,"Key Policy Responses as of July 1, 2020    The government launched a 4-pillar socioeconomic strategy against COVID-19, which includes support to vulnerable groups and individuals, expanded resources for frontline medical workers, as well as fiscal and monetary measures.    FISCAL  The government launched a PHP 595.6 billion fiscal package (about 3.1 percent of 2019 GDP) for vulnerable individuals and groups, which includes the following measures: (1) PHP 205 billion cash aid program (1.1 percent of 2019 GDP) for 18 million low-income households, under which eligible households are expected to receive cash transfers of between PHP 5,000 and PHP 8,000 a month for a period of two months; (2) over PHP 56 billion social protection measures for vulnerable workers, including for displaced and overseas Filipino workers (0.3 percent of 2019 GDP); (3) over PHP 54 billion on COVID-19-related medical response (0.3 percent of 2019 GDP); and (4) PHP 120 billion (0.6 percent of 2019 GDP) credit guarantee for small businesses and support to the agriculture sector. Financial assistance will also be provided to affected micro-, small-, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) and vulnerable households through specialized microfinancing loans and loan restructuring.    http://archive.fo/sGZ1z"
Philippines,PHL,East_Asia_Pacific,20200703,E2: Debt/contract relief,1,.,1.,0,"MONETARY AND MACRO-FINANCIAL  The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has reduced its policy rate four times in 2020 by a cumulative 175 bps to 2.25 percent and lowered the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks by 200 bps to 12 percent, effective from April 3.    To support the governmentâs programs to counter the impacts of COVID 19, the BSP purchased PHP 300 billion worth government securities (about 1.5 percent of 2019 GDP) through a repurchase agreement with the government, made secondary market purchases of government securities, and remitted PHP 20 billion as dividend to the government even though it is no longer required to make dividend payments to the government under the newly amended BSP charter. The BSP has also announced a series of regulatory relief measures for the banking sector, including: (1) a temporary relaxation of requirements on compliance reporting, penalties on required reserves, and single borrower limits; (2) easier access to the BSPâs rediscounting facility; (3) a temporary relaxation of provisioning requirements (subject to the BSP approval), and (4) a relaxation of prudential regulations regarding marking-to-market of debt securities. These relief measures are intended to encourage banks, in turn, to provide financial relief to their borrowers (e.g., temporary grace period for loan payments). To encourage extension of loans to enterprises, particularly, micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), the BSP allowed loans to MSMEs to be counted as part of banksâ compliance with reserve requirements, temporarily reduced their credit risk weights to 50 percent, and assigned zero risk weight to loan exposures guaranteed by the Philippine Guarantee Corporation.    http://archive.fo/sGZ1z"

He explained that the additional contact tracers would be immediately deployed particularly in areas with a high number of recorded COVID-19 cases.    He said they will prioritize hiring those graduates of medical allied sciences, graduates of criminology, and other similar courses.
