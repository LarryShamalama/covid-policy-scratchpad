Effective after midnight on Wednesday July 1, 2020, the following changes will be implemented:       Hotspot locations will be renamed as âHigh Risk Areasâ   For the US, risk status will be determined on a state-by-state level, to include territories.   The default level of quarantine required upon arrival on Guam is based on whether or not a traveler is coming from a High Risk Area.   A Pre-Arrival Negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Test, in particular those traveling from a High Risk Area, is necessary to determine the location of quarantine required and eligibility to qualify for an abbreviated quarantine length.   Residency status will NOT determine the level of quarantine or testing required. Considerations for alternate quarantine locations will still be made in certain limited circumstances.   High Risk locations will be determined by a calculated COVID-19 Area Risk (CAR) score, which primarily assesses an areaâs recently calculated Case Doubling Time and Test Positivity Rate.    Current high risk areas include: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Philippines, Africa, Central America, Middle East, and South America.
