""Social gatherings can be held with up to 100 people    The limit for social gatherings will be lifted to 100 people. These include events at home and outside of home like religious services, parties, weddings, tangihanga and funerals. It is important everyone keeps playing it safe.    This means: While hospitality businesses continue to have the 100 person limit per defined space, group bookings of more than 10 people will be permitted, but the 3 Sâs â seated, separated, single-server â still apply. A funeral or tangihanga will also have a 100 person limit, and organisers are no longer required to apply to the Ministry of Health to hold one. Social gatherings at a private dwelling will be able to have a maximum of 100 people. A business or responsible individual, in charge of a social gathering, must ensure records are kept for contact tracing purposes, except where every person in a gathering knows each other. This includes in your home, community hall, or other such space. Participating in community sport will also become easier, with greater numbers of people able to gather up to a limit of 100 people. Requirements for contact tracing still remain. Workers providing a service to a social gathering, such as waiters at a wedding, are not included in the 100 person limit.""    /web/20200602033409/https://covid19.govt.nz/latest-updates/alert-level-2-changes-confirmed-for-friday-29-may/"

Two more persons â one Timorese and one foreign national were also tested for COVID-19 but the test result from Australia came back as negative. They DO NOT have COVID-19 infection.
