An agreement with service provider (Banco BAI) was finalized and the communication plan revised. Two remote training sessions were provided on social protection, cash transfers, community involvement and registration of beneficiaries for municipal focal points and NGO Atos staff. This was accompanied by face-to-face training on digital processes using tablets to aid registration of beneficiaries. Registration of beneficiaries in target communities started and over 300 children had been registered by June 12th . The programme supports inclusion of vulnerable populations: of those registered so far, 60% are women-headed households, and 17% of caregivers and 3% of children have a disability.
