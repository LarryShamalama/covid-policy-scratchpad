In conjunction  with active case finding and testing, and in synergy with other measures such as physical  distancing, contact tracing is recommended in all transmission scenarios.  According to current knowledge, COVID 19 is passed from one person to another primarily  through droplet transmission. People in close contact with COVID-19 cases are at high  risk of being infected with COVID-19, and, if infected, may also transmit the infection to  others. This guideline details how once a COVID-19 case has been identified, the Ministry  of Health and Wellness (MoHW) through District Health Management Teams (DHMT) and  other implementing partners will track, trace and manage people who may have been  exposed to COVID-19.
